Saas - Software as a service 
software is not typically owned but leased to the user through the internet

Paas - Platform as a software
here the software or tool is provided to the user so that they can quickly develop an app

IaaS - Infrastructure as a Service
virtual computing and services that can be provided over the internet


Hypervisor there are 2 types of Hypervisor
type 1 - Baremetal
type 2 - Hosted

Tyoes of clouds - 
1. public clouds - 
these applications and services are open to general population and are free or leased for duration.
Internet is used for providing these services

2. private clouds - 
these are for specific organization or govt., these can be setup using a private network but these are costly to build and maintain

3. Hybrid clouds - 
these are made of 2 or mode clouds and they remain seperate but are connected with the same architecture. the access to the servies depends on the right to access

4. community clouds - 
these are designed for the use of a specific community and are customized according to their requirements.

Virtualization is what led to cloud computing 
the setup of virtual Os and servers had what led to cloud computing 
a single Service Provider OS was able to control several of the Host Os


there was a major drawback that when the server failed all the services provided by the servers were also not available these were called single point failures

also these servers remained idle and wasted the energy untill someone would try to access the services 


HYPERVISORS - 
this acts as a abstraction layer over the physical hardware 
and this absstraction layer allows the virtual  software to provide access to all the CPU ram and all the features of the physical device

Type  1 Bare metal - 
these were directly installed over the Hardware these were used at enterprise networks and data center networking devices 
they are more effective as they have direct access to the hardware
